# Hubspot AJAX Forms ðŸš€
A lightweight toolkit for interacting with Hubspot's AJAX Form Submission endpoint. No dependencies, no BS.

## How You Will Be Able To Use It
1) Use a `new HubspotAjaxForm()` instance. Simply pass it two arguments: the CSS Selector for your form, and an Object of options.
2) Include this library on a page and throw some data-attributes on your form.
